# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Document significant technical decisions made during the homelab project. This helps maintain consistency and provides context for future changes.

## Format

Each decision should include:
- Date and ADR number
- Context (why the decision was needed)
- Decision (what was chosen)
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences (trade-offs, implications)

## Entries

### ADR-001: GitOps with ArgoCD App-of-Apps Pattern (Established)

**Context:**
- Need a declarative approach to manage Kubernetes resources
- Want to track all infrastructure changes in Git
- Multiple applications with complex dependencies

**Decision:**
- Use ArgoCD with App-of-Apps pattern
- Three-tier structure: gitops -> addons -> applications
- Sync waves for dependency ordering

**Alternatives Considered:**
- FluxCD -> Less mature UI, different sync model
- Direct kubectl/Helm -> No GitOps benefits, harder to audit

**Consequences:**
- Full audit trail of all changes
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Requires understanding of sync waves and health checks
- More complex initial setup

### ADR-002: Talos Linux for Kubernetes Nodes (Established)

**Context:**
- Need immutable, secure Kubernetes nodes
- Want minimal attack surface
- Running on Proxmox VE virtualization

**Decision:**
- Use Talos Linux as the node OS
- API-driven configuration (no SSH)
- Custom images with NVIDIA drivers for GPU support

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Ubuntu + kubeadm -> More maintenance, larger attack surface
- k3s on Debian -> Simpler but less security hardening
- RKE2 -> More traditional but not immutable

**Consequences:**
- Highly secure, immutable nodes
- No SSH access (API-only management)
- Custom image builds required for GPU support
- Steeper learning curve for troubleshooting

### ADR-003: 1Password + SOPS for Secrets Management (Established)

**Context:**
- Need to manage secrets for Kubernetes applications
- Want secrets encrypted in Git
- Already using 1Password for personal credential management

**Decision:**
- Use 1Password Connect for runtime secret injection
- Use SOPS with Age encryption for secrets in Git
- 1Password Operator creates Kubernetes secrets from 1Password items

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Sealed Secrets -> Requires cluster-side key management
- HashiCorp Vault -> Overkill for homelab, more infrastructure
- External Secrets Operator alone -> Still need secret storage backend

**Consequences:**
- Secrets encrypted at rest in Git
- Single source of truth in 1Password
- Requires 1Password Connect server running
- Bootstrap complexity (chicken-and-egg with initial secrets)

### ADR-004: Democratic-CSI for NFS Storage (Established)

**Context:**
- Need persistent storage for stateful applications
- Have TrueNAS server with large storage pool
- Want dynamic provisioning in Kubernetes

**Decision:**
- Use Democratic-CSI with NFS backend
- Connect to TrueNAS via API for dynamic provisioning
- Use allowInsecure for self-signed TrueNAS certificate

**Alternatives Considered:**
- NFS-subdir-external-provisioner -> Less features, no snapshot support
- Longhorn -> Requires local node storage, not NAS-backed
- Rook-Ceph -> Much more complex, overkill for homelab

**Consequences:**
- Dynamic NFS provisioning works well
- Snapshot support available
- Dependent on TrueNAS API availability
- Self-signed cert requires allowInsecure

### ADR-005: TypeScript for All Scripting (Established)

**Context:**
- Need automation scripts for infrastructure tasks
- Want type safety and modern tooling
- Avoid shell script complexity

**Decision:**
- Use TypeScript with Deno runtime for all scripts
- No Bash or Python scripts
- Explicit Deno permissions for security

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Bash -> Traditional but error-prone, hard to maintain
- Python -> Good but less type safety
- Go -> Overkill for scripts, slower iteration

**Consequences:**
- Type-safe automation
- Modern async/await patterns
- Requires Deno installation
- Some learning curve for shell-to-TS conversion

### ADR-006: Unified NFS Permission Model — apps:users (568:100) (2026-02-09)

**Context:**
- Containers run as UID 568 (apps) with GID 100 (users) per TrueCharts convention
- Democratic-CSI provisions NFS shares with mapall for k8s PVC datasets
- Media datasets (movies, tv, downloads, etc.) use direct NFS mounts, not CSI
- Initial setup used `rmcafee:users` for media shares and `apps:users` for k8s — causing permission mismatches when containers accessed media NFS mounts

**Decision:**
- ALL NFS shares use `mapall_user: apps, mapall_group: users` (568:100)
- ALL datasets owned by `apps:users` (568:100) with mode 770
- Single permission model for both CSI-provisioned and direct NFS mounts
- SMB access still works via group `users` (GID 100) shared between `rmcafee` and `apps`

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep `rmcafee:users` for media, `apps:users` for k8s → Split model, confusing, permission bugs
- Use `maproot` instead of `mapall` → Only maps UID 0, non-root containers get denied

**Consequences:**
- All media apps (NZBGet, Sonarr, Radarr, etc.) can access NFS mounts consistently
- SMB clients (desktop) still have access via group membership
- Dataset ownership is `apps` not `rmcafee` — SMB writes will appear as `apps` user
- Script `truenas-nfs-mapall.ts --all --fix-permissions` applies the full fix

## Tips

- Number decisions sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
- Include date for temporal context
- Be honest about trade-offs (both positive and negative consequences)
- Keep alternatives brief - just enough to show what was considered
- Don't include implementation details - focus on the "why" not the "how"
